Nft Market Place

## Big Thanks

To Filip Jerga Software Engineer Instructor on Udemy.com

I had to revamp the architecture, update the smart contracts and PIN√ÉTA cloud usage syntaxes for the app to work in the world of React state loading and management sequence.

## How To

1. Clone the repository code.

2. cd to the root directory of the project and run npm install.

3. Configure the .env.development or .env.production file properly.

4. Since we are deploying the demo on Sepolia Test Network, make sure you register for one and configure the file keys.json properly.

5. While at the root directory of the project, use truffle to migrate and deploy the smart contracts on the Sepolia Test Network of the Ethereum blockchain.

6. Then, use npm build to build the app.

7. Finally, deploy the app and start enjoying your NFT marketplace.
